## KEY ADVICE 

1.  Mechanism = primary or secondary? 
  a.	Primary (90%) = pupil block or peripheral iris crowding 
  b.	Secondary (10%) = lens induced, causes behind lens
 c.	?Pupil block present: Peripheral iris usually flattens on indentation gonioscopy in pupil block PACG
 d.	If pupil block present, but AC is asymmetrically   shallow centrally, consider secondary causes 

2. Treat relevant cause 
 a.	PACG = see management 
 b. If suspect secondary causes eg lens, aqueous misdirection, choroidals, etc, lower IOP, but **DISCUSS WITH GLAUCOMA CONSULTANT** before using pilocarpine 

3.	All PACG should have bilateral PIs before leaving department 

4.	Arrange follow-up at 7 days 

 ## MANAGEMENT 

 
 ### _IMMEDIATE_ 
 
1. Diamox 500mg IV (if acute + symptoms)
2. Pilocarpine 2% (4% dark irides)
3. Timolol 0.25% (check contraindications: asthma, heartblock)
4. Iopidine 0.5%
5. Pred forte 1%
6. Lie patient supine 
7. Analgesia/antiemetics 

 ### _REASSESS @ 60 MIN_ 
 
1.  IOP still elevated: 
a. Consider indenting central cornea gently with 4 mirror lens or moistened cotton bud. 2â€“3 cycles of 30s on/off 
b. Discuss with glaucoma/urgent care consultant regarding further management

2.	IOP reduced 
a. Bilateral PIs, then if IOP controlled, discharge on:
i. Pilocarpine 2% qid (4% dark irides)
ii.	Apraclonidine 0.5% tid
iii. Pred forte 1% 2-hourly, qid in fellow eye 
iv.	Acetazolamide PO 250mg qid, (omit if IOP <10mm HG)
   
   b. Book follow-up 7 days glaucoma clinic. Notify consultant of patient.
 
 ## CAUTION 
 
**All urgent care cases should be discussed with the allocated urgent care consultant of the day (listed on rota)**



1.	Acetazolomide: 
a.	Careful use of in elderly &/or small patients
b.	Check contraindications
c.	Explain likely SEs, and what to do if concerned

2.	Pilocarpine: 
a.	Do not use intensively
b.	May be ineffective if IOP>50, can also cause paradoxical A/C shallowing and worsen pupil block if used intensively
